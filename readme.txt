Shoptricity Links is one of easiest ways to monetize your website because it converts links on your website to revenue generating links.

== Description ==

The Shoptricity Links plugin uses the Shoptricity.com shopping platform to give you instant access to hundreds of online retailers, lead generation websites, service websites, and much more.

Shoptricity Links works by checking every outbound link on your website for one of the thousands of revenue generating opportunities available. It will not modify pre-existing affiliate links on your website.

This plugin will send the visitor on your website to the exact same page you intended to send them to, the only difference is you will have the opportunity to make money if that person purchases an item, fills out a form, or one of many other actions.

Earnings can be tracked by visiting Shoptricity.com and logging in with your credentials. Shoptricity.com only takes a cut from new revenue that this plugin generates for you. You also have the option to donate your earnings to one of the organizations that works with Shoptricity.com.
